# BLOG-APP  
This is my first web app that I coded using Semantic UI on the client side and on the server side; NodeJs using a framework called express to interact with the database(mongoose). NOTE: At the time I am making this note...This is my first time deploying a full web app to github.AT THE TIME I POSTED THIS ON GITHUB, MY SHIFT KEY IS GIVING ISSUES, CAUSES THE INCONSISTENCIES IN MY TYPING 
# NOTE
Run `npm init` and install the necessary dependencies in order to update node_modules folder files. The dependencies neededare in packge.json
